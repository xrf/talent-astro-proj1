Topic
-----

Simulate the effects of a near-Earth supernova explosion at 10 parsec (the
"kill radius") and the resulting collision of the blast with solar wind.  Will
the supernova reach 1 AU?  How does the answer depend on the:

- supernova explosion energy,
- distance, and
- interstellar density?
