Roles
-----

- **Analysis:**     Alexander Dombos
- **Code:**         Fei Yuan
- **Parameter:**    Heiko MÃ¶ller

Goals
-----

  * Perform a simulation of a supernova explosion near the Solar system (at,
    say, 10 parsec) using the VH1 hydrodynamics solver.

  * Explore the effects of the explosion (in particular, near the orbit of the
    Earth) and how they vary depending on the energy of the supernova
    (relative to the force of the Solar wind), proximity, and density.
